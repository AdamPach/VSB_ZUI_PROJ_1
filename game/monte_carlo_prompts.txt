Hello, I am doing a 2048 solver in Python. I have already prepared a game which is represented as an object which provides a methods. Your job is to create a monte carlo solver with a heuristic. I will give you the game implementation.
------
It mostly fails during 512 tile is on the playground. I will give you last result of the game, Can you analyze it and improve the parameters and weights

Hello, I am doing a 2048 solver in Python. I have already prepared a game which is represented as an object which provides a methods. Your job is to create a monte carlo solver without heurestic, Just simulate the game till the end evaluate the results and decide the best move. I will give you the game implementation
